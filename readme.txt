The whole point of this morning challenge is to continue to work on javascript well after the bootcamp. 

I have started this with a couple others from my cohort and we have decided to hold eachother accountable by maintaining one javascript challenege every morning between 9 - 9:30am 

Take a look and see what challeneges interests you most. Will keep adding! ðŸ˜¬
