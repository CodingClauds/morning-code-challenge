## Morning Challenge - Javascript


The whole point of this morning challenge is to continue to work on building our knowledge of javascript well after the bootcamp. I have started this with a couple others from my cohort and we have decided to hold eachother accountable by maintaining a javascript challenege or leetcode chalenege in the mornings between 9:00 - 10:00.

Take a look and see what challeneges interests you most. Will keep adding!
